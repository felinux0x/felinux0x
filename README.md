```

## Methodology

```
[1] RECONNAISSANCE    → Gather intelligence on target systems
[2] SCANNING          → Identify open ports and services  
[3] ENUMERATION       → Extract detailed system information
[4] EXPLOITATION      → Gain unauthorized access
[5] POST-EXPLOITATION → Maintain access and escalate privileges
[6] REPORTING         → Document findings with remediation guidance
```

## Philosophy

> In the world of cybersecurity, the best defense comes from understanding the offense. Every vulnerability discovered is an opportunity to make systems stronger. Every exploit developed is a lesson in secure architecture.

Security is not about building impenetrable walls it's about understanding how walls can be breached and constantly reinforcing them.
